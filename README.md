# Namaste React 

# Parcel
    - Dev Build
    - Local server creation
    - HMR => hot module replacement (HOT RELODING)
    - file watching algo.=> written in c++ langauge.
    - Caching- faster build 
    - Image optimisation 
    - as it is a buldler so bundling
    - compressing (removing white space inside code)
    - Minification
    - consistent hashing
    - code splitting 
    - differntial bundling => as our app is going to run on various devices and versions so it will support in that case
    - Diagonostic => gives beautiful error message in console
    - error handling
    - HTTPs
    - Tree shaking algo => remove uncessary code (leaves of trees)( e.g. if we are using 4-5 functions so parcel will remove other not useful functions)
    - Diffrent build for dev and production
